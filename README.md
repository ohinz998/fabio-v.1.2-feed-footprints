# fabio-v.1.2-feed-footprints
This R file contains the calculations and visualizations for livestock feed biodiversity footprints and works together with the fabio v1.2 IO model. 

The work here is unpublished (as of 03/25) and will be handed in for scientific publication. In case you are interested in a collaboration, I am happy to receive inquiries at <olivia.hinz@wu.ac.at>.
